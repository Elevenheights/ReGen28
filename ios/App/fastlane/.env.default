# Appflow passes `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=iPhone Developer: ...` which forces manual identity
# into SPM package targets and causes:
#   "target is automatically signed, but code signing identity ... has been manually specified"
# Override gym's identity to the generic Xcode setting so automatic signing can proceed.
