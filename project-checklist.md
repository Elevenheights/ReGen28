## Phase 0: Architecture Alignment ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### 0.1. System Architecture & Data Flow
- [x] Defined high-level architecture:
    - Ionic + Angular client (Capacitor for native iOS / Android builds)
    - Firebase backend (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage, Hosting)
    - Angular service layer between UI components and Firebase SDK
    - Central **Dashboard** page as the hub that aggregates data from Trackers, Journal, Goals, and Settings
