# Project Checklist: ReGen28 Wellness App (Ionic + Firebase)

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW & METHODOLOGY**

### **Current System Architecture (Clean Production-Ready)**
This project follows a **clean, centralized architecture** with no hacks, patches, or scattered logic. All code has been systematically cleaned and organized for maintainability and scalability.

#### **Core Infrastructure Services**
- **ErrorHandlingService** - Centralized error management with standardized error codes (AUTH, DATA, NETWORK, AI, FIREBASE) with graceful error handling patterns
- **LoggingService** - Environment-aware structured logging (debug/info/warn/error levels, respects production)
- **ConfigService** - Single source of truth for all app configuration, tracker templates, and defaults

#### **Service Layer Architecture**
- **DatabaseService** - Abstract layer for all Firebase operations with error handling and caching
- **UserService** - User profile management, stats, preferences (uses ErrorHandling + Logging)
- **TrackerService** - Tracker CRUD, analytics, duration management (uses Config + Fallback services)
- **AuthService** - Authentication with comprehensive error handling
- **AIRecommendationsService** - OpenAI integration with fallbacks
- **OnboardingService** - Multi-step flow with AI integration

#### **Client-Server Shared Configuration**
- **src/app/services/config.service.ts** - Client-side centralized config
- **functions/src/shared-config.ts** - Server-side shared config (identical templates)
- **Ensures consistency** between client and Firebase Functions for tracker templates and defaults

#### **Data Flow & Error Handling**
1. **Components** ‚Üí **Services** ‚Üí **DatabaseService** ‚Üí **Firebase**
2. **All errors** flow through ErrorHandlingService with user-friendly messages and graceful degradation
3. **All logging** uses structured LoggingService (no console.log statements)
4. **Real data calculations** - no fake/random data anywhere, proper error handling instead of fallbacks

#### **Production-Ready Features**
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Error Boundaries** - Graceful degradation for all service failures
- ‚úÖ **Structured Logging** - Environment-aware, production-safe logging
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Config** - Single source of truth for all templates/defaults
- ‚úÖ **Performance Optimized** - Cached observables, reduced Firebase queries
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture** - No patches, hacks, or scattered logic

### **Development Methodology**
- **Clean Code First** - No temporary solutions or "TODO" fixes
- **Centralized Over Scattered** - All similar logic consolidated into services
- **Real Data Only** - No fake/placeholder data in production code
- **Structured Error Handling** - Consistent patterns across all services
- **Environment Awareness** - Different behavior for development vs production
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive interfaces and null safety

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PREFERENCES & IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS**

> **IMPORTANT**: All future development MUST follow these principles to maintain code quality and consistency.

### **üéØ Core Development Principles**
1. **CENTRALIZE EVERYTHING** - All logic, models, and data must be centralized as much as possible
2. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Never repeat code; create shared utilities, services, and constants instead
3. **NO FALLBACKS** - Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages, don't mask failures with fake data
4. **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - One place for all configuration, templates, defaults, and business logic
5. **REAL DATA ONLY** - No Math.random(), hardcoded values, or placeholder data in production
6. **GRACEFUL ERROR HANDLING** - Use ErrorHandlingService patterns for consistent user experience

### **üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Standards**
- **Services First** - Always implement logic in services, not components
- **Dependency Injection** - Use Angular DI for all service dependencies 
- **Observable Patterns** - Use RxJS for reactive data flows with shareReplay(1) caching
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive interfaces and null checks everywhere
- **Structured Logging** - Use LoggingService, never console.log statements
- **Database Abstraction** - All Firebase operations through DatabaseService
- **Shared Configuration** - Client-server consistency via shared config files

### **üö´ Strictly Forbidden**
- ‚ùå Duplicate code across components/services
- ‚ùå Hardcoded values scattered throughout codebase
- ‚ùå Fallback data that masks real errors or missing functionality
- ‚ùå Console.log statements (use LoggingService)
- ‚ùå Direct Firebase calls (use DatabaseService)
- ‚ùå Temporary solutions or "TODO" fixes
- ‚ùå Fake data generated with Math.random()

### **‚úÖ Always Required**
- ‚úÖ Centralized logic in dedicated services
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for all configuration
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with user feedback
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- ‚úÖ Consistent patterns across all features
- ‚úÖ Real data from proper sources
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable, production-ready code

*These standards ensure maintainable, scalable, and professional code quality throughout the entire application.*
